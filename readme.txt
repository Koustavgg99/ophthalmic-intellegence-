Glaucoma Detection using Deep Learning

üìå Project Overview

This project explores AI-driven glaucoma detection and progression prediction using various deep learning and machine learning architectures. The study compares multiple models applied to fundus photographs, OCT images, visual field (VF) data, intraocular pressure (IOP), and electronic health records (EHR). The objective is to identify efficient, accurate, and generalizable models for early glaucoma diagnosis and progression monitoring.

The project also emphasizes the advantages of Multiclass UNet (for segmentation) and ResNet150 + Inception V3 (for classification), highlighting their superior performance over existing models.
